# So, you are stuck ...

{{%fragment%}}
<span style="font-size: 2.5rem;">*First,* **look** for information that is already out there</span>
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
<span style="font-size: 2.5rem;">*Then,* **ask** for help</span>
{{%/fragment%}}

<br>

---

## Look for information

1. Read carefully any **error message**
2. Read the **documentation** (local or online)
3. Make sure you have **up-to-date versions**
4. **Google** (using carefully selected keywords or the error message)
5. Look for **open issues** & **bug reports**

---

### Error messages

{{%fragment%}}
<span style="font-size: 2.5rem;">**Read them!**</span>
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
Familiarise yourself with the error types in the languages you use\\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Example: Python's **syntax errors** vs **exceptions**.
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
Warnings ≠ errors
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
Look for bits you understand (don't get put off by what you don't understand)
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
Identify the locations of the errors to go investigate that part of the code
{{%/fragment%}}

<!-- --- -->

<!-- ### Error messages -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- Python invalid syntax: -->

<!-- found during the parsing stage: when the interpreter parse the code to convert it to Python byte code. -->

### Documentation

{{%/fragment%}}

---

#### <font color="#e67300">Finding</font> documentation <font color="#e67300">online</font>

Take the time to look for the official documentation & other high quality sources for the languages & tools you use.

{{%fragment%}}
&emsp;*Examples:*

&emsp;&emsp;Python: [Reference manual](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html), [Standard library manual](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html), [Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) \\
&emsp;&emsp;NumPy: [Tutorial](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/tutorials_index.html) \\
&emsp;&emsp;R: [Open source book "R for Data Science"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html), [Open source book "Advanced R"](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) \\
&emsp;&emsp;Julia: [Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) \\

### Up-to-date versions

{{%fragment%}}
**First, you need to know what needs to be updated.**
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
Keeping a system up to date includes updating:

- the OS
- the program
- (any potential IDE)
- packages
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
**Then, you need to update regularly.**
{{%/fragment%}}

---

### Google

Google's algorithms are great at guessing what we are looking for.<br><br>

{{%fragment%}}
*But* there is a frequency problem:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Searches relating to programming-specific questions represent too small &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a fraction of the overall searches for results to be relevant unless you use &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**key vocabulary**.<br><br>
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
Be precise.<br>
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
Learn the vocabulary of your language/tool to know what to search for.
{{%/fragment%}}

---

### Open issues & bug reports

If the tool you are using is open source, look for issues matching your problem in the source repository (e.g. on GitHub or GitLab).
