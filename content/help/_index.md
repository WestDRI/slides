## What to do when you get stuck?
<br>

1. Read carefully any **error message**
2. Read the **documentation** (local or online)
3. Make sure you have an **up-to-date version**
4. **Google** (using carefully selected keywords or the error message)
5. Look for **open issues** and **bug reports**

---

### Error messages
<br>
**Read it**

Warnings ≠ Errors

Identify the location of the error





---

### Documentation
<br>
There is often a lot of resources available, but people new to programming are not good (because nobody taught them) at making use of it.

Let's look at a few examples.

---

<br>
### Up-to-date version
<br>
First, you need to know what needs to be updated.

There can be a lot of confusion between a program and the IDE in which it is commonly used (typical example: R vs RStudio).

Keeping a system up to date includes updating:

- the OS
- the program
- (any potential IDE)
- packages

---

### Google
<br>
We all turn to Google all the time. Google's algorithms are powerful and good at guessing what we want.

But there is a number problem: searches looking for programming-specific answers represent too small a fraction of the overall searches for results to be relevant unless you use **key vocabulary**.

---

### Open issues and bug reports
<br>

## What if the information you need just isn't out there?
<br>

When everything has failed and you have to ask for help, you need to figure out: <br><br>

## Where to ask
<br>

#### <div align="left">Q&A</div>

Mostly, **Stack Exchange network**.

Co-founded by [Jeff Atwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood) and [Joel Spolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky).

#### <div align="left">Forum</div>

Mostly, **Discourse**.
