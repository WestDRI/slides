# So, you are stuck ...
<br>

{{%fragment%}}
<span style="font-size: 2.5rem;">*First,* **look** for information that is already out there</span>
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
<span style="font-size: 2.5rem;">*Then,* **ask** for help</span>
{{%/fragment%}}

<br>

<br>
## Look for information
<br>

1. Read carefully any **error message**
2. Read the **documentation** (local or online)
3. Make sure you have **up-to-date versions**
4. **Google** (using carefully selected keywords or the error message)
5. Look for **open issues** and **bug reports**

---

### Error messages
<br>

{{%fragment%}}
<span style="font-size: 2.5rem;">**Read them!**</span>
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
Familiarise yourself with the error types in the languages you use\\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Example: Python's **syntax errors** vs **exceptions**.
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
Warnings ≠ errors
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
Look for bits you understand (don't get put off by what you don't understand)
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
Identify the locations of the errors to go investigate that part of the code
{{%/fragment%}}

### Documentation
<br>

{{%fragment%}}
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**You need to <font color="#e67300">find</font> it**<br><br>

{{%fragment%}}
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**You need to <font color="#e67300">understand</font> it**
{{%/fragment%}}

---

#### <font color="#e67300">Finding</font> documentation <font color="#e67300">online</font>
<br>
Take the time to look for the official documentation & other high quality sources for the languages & tools you use.<br><br>

{{%fragment%}}
*Examples:*

Python: [Reference manual](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html), [Standard library manual](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html), [Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) \\
NumPy: [Tutorial](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/tutorials_index.html) \\
R: [Open source book "R for Data Science"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html), [Open source book "Advanced R"](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) \\
Julia: [Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) \\
Bash: [Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html) \\
Git: [Manual](https://git-scm.com/docs), [Open source book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

### Up-to-date versions
<br>

{{%fragment%}}
**First, you need to know what needs to be updated.**
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
Keeping a system up to date includes updating:

- the OS
- the program
- (any potential IDE)
- packages
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
**Then, you need to update regularly.**
{{%/fragment%}}

---

### Google
<br>
Google's algorithms are great at guessing what we are looking for.<br><br>

{{%fragment%}}
*But* there is a frequency problem:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Searches relating to programming-specific questions represent too small &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a fraction of the overall searches for results to be relevant unless you use &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**key vocabulary**.<br><br>
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
Be precise.<br>
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
Learn the vocabulary of your language/tool to know what to search for.
{{%/fragment%}}

---

### Open issues and bug reports
<br>
If the tool you are using is open source, look for issues matching your problem in the source repository (e.g. on GitHub or GitLab).

## What if the answer <font color="#e67300">isn't</font> out there?
<br>

When everything has failed and you have to ask for help, you need to know: <br><br>

#### Additional considerations
<br>

{{%fragment%}}
Even if you always find answers to your questions without having to post yourself, **consider signing up** to these sites:
{{%/fragment%}}

<br>

{{%fragment%}}
It allows you to upvote (SO/SE) or like (Discourse) the questions and answers that help you—why not thank those that are making your life easier by upvoting/liking their posts?
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
It makes you a part of these communities.
{{%/fragment%}}

{{%fragment%}}
Once you are signed up, maybe you will start being more involved & contribute with questions and/or answers :)
